<p>There are many translations of the book available in different human languages, thanks to many tireless volunteers!</p>
<p>If you want to help with these translations, please see the list of volunteers and languages below and decide if you want to start a new translation or help in existing translation projects.</p>
<p>If you plan to start a new translation, please read the <a href="translation_howto.html#translation-howto">Translation how-to</a>.</p>
<h2 id="arabic">Arabic</h2>

<p>Jahangir Shabiyev (c.shabiev@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Azerbaijani. The translation is in progress at <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/jahangir-sh/piton-sancmasi" target="_blank">https://www.gitbook.com/book/jahangir-sh/piton-sancmasi</a></p>
<h2 id="brazilian-portuguese">Brazilian Portuguese</h2>
<p>There are two translations in various levels of completion and accessibility. The older translation is now missing/lost, and newer translation is incomplete.</p>
<p>Samuel Dias Neto (samuel.arataca@gmail.com) made the first Brazilian Portuguese translation (older translation) of this book when Python was in 2.3.5 version. This is no longer publicly accessible.</p>
<p><a href="http://rodrigoamaral.net" target="_blank">Rodrigo Amaral</a> (rodrigoamaral@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Brazilian Portuguese, (newer translation) which still remains to be completed.</p>
<h2 id="catalan">Catalan</h2>
<p>Moises Gomez (moisesgomezgiron@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Catalan. The translation is in progress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MoisÃ¨s GÃ³mez - I am a developer and also a teacher of programming (normally for people without any previous experience).</p>
<p>Some time ago I needed to learn how to program in Python, and Swaroop's work was really helpful. Clear, concise, and complete enough. Just what I needed.</p>
<p>After this experience, I thought some other people in my country could take benefit from it too. But English language can be a barrier.</p>
<p>So, why not try to translate it? And I did for a previous version of BoP.</p>
<p>I my country there are two official languages. I selected the Catalan language assuming that others will translate it to the more widespread Spanish.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chinese">Chinese</h2>
<p>In 2017 which is after 11 years, Mo Lun (i@molun.net) re-translated the book from the beginning based on Version 4.0. And the translation is storaged in GitHub and Gitbook. He is keeping follow this translated edition and ready to fix it if there is any wrong or mistake in the translated BoP.</p>
<p>The 2017 translation edition is available in <a href="https://bop.molun.net" target="_blank">https://bop.molun.net</a>.</p>
<p>Mo Lun Says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a common journalism student from CYU, Beijing. And actually, I am an absolute newbie in Python programming when I start to translate this book. Initially, it was just a whim, but when I done this work, I realized that a decision triggered by interest had prompted me to go so far.</p>
<p>With the help of my predecessorsâ translations and the vast amount of information provided by the developed Internet, and with the help of my friends, I prudently presented this translation edition. I just hope my translation work will help other newcomers in learning Python.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am always waiting for my translation of the comments and suggestions, and ready to change or improve this superficial work.</p>

<h3 id="earlier-chinese-translation">Earlier Chinese translation</h3>
<p>In 2005, Shen Jieyuan translated this book with version 1.20 to Chinese and published it to the Internet. This is the first Chinese edition. In BoP official site, he was called Juan Shen, with Email adderss orion_val@163.comãThis edition has been disseminated on the network widely, and the links provided by BoP official site are not available anymore, so that its original source is unable to find. Therefore in here canât provide a certain address. But you can try to search keywords like âç®æPythonæç¨ æ²æ´åâ to find a copy.</p>
<p>Juan Shen says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a postgraduate at Wireless Telecommunication Graduate School, Beijing University of Technology, China PR. My current research interest is on the synchronization, channel estimation and multi-user detection of multicarrier CDMA system. Python is my major programming language for daily simulation and research job, with the help of Python Numeric, actually. I learned Python just half a year before, but as you can see, it's really easy-understanding, easy-to-use and productive. Just as what is ensured in Swaroop's book, 'It's my favorite programming language now'.</p>
<p>'A Byte of Python' is my tutorial to learn Python. It's clear and effective to lead you into a world of Python in the shortest time. It's not too long, but efficiently covers almost all important things in Python. I think 'A Byte of Python' should be strongly recommendable for newbies as their first Python tutorial. Just dedicate my translation to the potential millions of Python users in China.</p>

<p>Fred Lin (gasolin@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Chinese Traditional.</p>
<p>It is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy</a>.</p>
<p>An exciting feature of this translation is that it also contains the <em>executable chinese python sources</em> side by side with the original python sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred Lin - I'm working as a network firmware engineer at Delta Network, and I'm also a contributor of TurboGears web framework.</p>
<p>As a python evangelist (:-p), I need some material to promote python language. I found 'A Byte of Python' hit the sweet point for both newbies and experienced programmers. 'A Byte of Python' elaborates the python essentials with affordable size.</p>
<p>The translation are originally based on simplified chinese version, and soon a lot of rewrite were made to fit the current wiki version and the quality of reading.</p>
<p>The recent chinese traditional version also featured with executable chinese python sources, which are achieved by my new 'zhpy' (python in chinese) project (launch from Aug 07).</p>
<p>zhpy(pronounce (Z.H.?, or zippy) build a layer upon python to translate or interact with python in chinese(Traditional or Simplified). This project is mainly aimed for education.</p>

<p>Lutz Horn (lutz.horn@gmx.de), Bernd Hengelein (bernd.hengelein@gmail.com) and Christoph Zwerschke (cito@online.de) have volunteered to translate the book to German.</p>

<p>Lutz Horn says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm 32 years old and have a degree of Mathematics from University of Heidelberg, Germany. Currently I'm working as a software engineer on a publicly funded project to build a web portal for all things related to computer science in Germany.The main language I use as a professional is Java, but I try to do as much as possible with Python behind the scenes. Especially text analysis and conversion is very easy with Python. I'm not very familiar with GUI toolkits, since most of my programming is about web applications, where the user interface is build using Java frameworks like Struts. Currently I try to make more use of the functional programming features of Python and of generators.  After taking a short look into Ruby, I was very impressed with the use of blocks in this language. Generally I like the dynamic nature of languages like Python and Ruby since it allows me to do things not possible in more static languages like Java.I've searched for some kind of introduction to programming, suitable to teach a complete non-programmer. I've found the book 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python', and 'Dive into Python'. The first is good for beginners but to long to translate. The second is not suitable for beginners. I think 'A Byte of Python' falls nicely between these, since it is not too long, written to the point, and at the same time verbose enough to teach a newbie. Besides this, I like the simple DocBook structure, which makes translating the text a generation the output in various formats a charm.</p>

<p>Bernd Hengelein says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lutz and me are going to do the german translation together. We just started with the intro and preface but we will keep you informed about the progress we make. Ok, now some personal things about me. I am 34 years old and playing with computers since the 1980's, when the "Commodore C64" ruled the nurseries. After studying computer science I started working as a software engineer. Currently I am working in the field of medical imaging for a major german company. Although C++ is the main language I (have to) use for my daily work, I am constantly looking for new things to learn.Last year I fell in love with Python, which is a wonderful language, both for its possibilities and its beauty. I read somewhere in the net about a guy who said that he likes python, because the code looks so beautiful. In my opinion he's absolutly right. At the time I decided to learn python, I noticed that there is very little good documentation in german available. When I came across your book the spontaneous idea of a german translation crossed my mind. Luckily, Lutz had the same idea and we can now divide the work.I am looking forward to a good cooperation!</p>

<p>But at that time only few Python books are available in Korean, so I decided to translate your ebook because it looks like one of the best guides that I have ever read!</p>
<p>Currently, the book is almost completely translated in Korean, except some of the text in introduction chapter and the appendixes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Eirik VÃ¥geskar</em>: I have always wanted to program, but because I speak a small language, the learning process was much harder. Most tutorials and books are written in very technical English, so most high school graduates will not even have the vocabulary to understand what the tutorial is about. When I discovered this book, all my problems were solved. "A Byte of Python" used simple non-technical language to explain a programming language that is just as simple, and these two things make learning Python fun. After reading half of the book, I decided that the book was worth translating. I hope the translation will help people who have found themself in the same situation as me (especially young people), and maybe help spread interest for the language among people with less technical knowledge.</p>
