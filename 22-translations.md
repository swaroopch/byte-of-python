## Brazilian Portuguese ##

There are two translations:

[Samuel Dias Neto](http://www.samueldiasneto.com/aprendendopython/index.html)
(samuel.arataca-at-gmail-dot-com) made the first Brazilian Portuguese
translation of this book when Python was in 2.3.5 version.

Samuel's translation is available at
[aprendendopython](http://www.samueldiasneto.com/aprendendopython/index.html).

[Rodrigo Amaral](http://rodrigoamaral.net)
(rodrigoamaral-at-gmail-dot-com) has volunteered to translate the book
to Brazilian Portuguese.

Rodrigo's translation is available at
[http://www.swaroopch.org/notes/Python_pt-br:Indice](http://www.swaroopch.org/notes/Python_pt-br:Indice).

## Catalan ##

Moises Gomez (moisesgomezgiron-at-gmail-dot-com) has volunteered to
translate the book to Catalan.  The translation is in progress, and
was present in the [erstwhile wiki](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/).

> Moisès Gómez - I am a developer and also a teacher of programming
> (normally for people without any previous experience).

> Some time ago I needed to learn how to program in Python, and
> Swaroop's work was really helpful. Clear, concise, and complete
> enough. Just what I needed.

> After this experience, I thought some other people in my country
> could take benefit from it too. But English language can be a
> barrier.

> So, why not try to translate it? And I did for a previous version of
> BoP.

> I my country there are two official languages. I selected the
> Catalan language assuming that others will translate it to the more
> widespread Spanish.

## Chinese ##

A translation is available at
<http://woodpecker.org.cn/abyteofpython_cn/chinese/>.

Juan Shen (orion-underscore-val-at-163-dot-com) has volunteered to
translate the book to Chinese.

> I am a postgraduate at Wireless Telecommunication Graduate School,
> Beijing University of Technology, China PR. My current research
> interest is on the synchronization, channel estimation and
> multi-user detection of multicarrier CDMA system. Python is my major
> programming language for daily simulation and research job, with the
> help of Python Numeric, actually. I learned Python just half a year
> before, but as you can see, it's really easy-understanding,
> easy-to-use and productive. Just as what is ensured in Swaroop's
> book, 'It's my favorite programming language now'.

> 'A Byte of Python' is my tutorial to learn Python. It's clear and
> effective to lead you into a world of Python in the shortest time.
> It's not too long, but efficiently covers almost all important
> things in Python. I think 'A Byte of Python' should be strongly
> recommendable for newbies as their first Python tutorial. Just
> dedicate my translation to the potential millions of Python users in
> China.

## Chinese Traditional ##

Fred Lin (gasolin-at-gmail-dot-com) has volunteered to translate the
book to Chinese Traditional.

It is available at [http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy](http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy).

An exciting feature of this translation is that it also contains the
*executable chinese python sources* side by side with the original
python sources.

> **Fred Lin** - I'm working as a network firmware engineer at Delta
> Network, and I'm also a contributor of TurboGears web framework.

> As a python evangelist (:-p), I need some material to promote python
> language. I found 'A Byte of Python' hit the sweet point for both
> newbies and experienced programmers. 'A Byte of Python' elaborates
> the python essentials with affordable size.

> The translation are originally based on simplified chinese version,
> and soon a lot of rewrite were made to fit the current wiki version
> and the quality of reading.

> The recent chinese traditional version also featured with executable
> chinese python sources, which are achieved by my new 'zhpy' (python
> in chinese) project (launch from Aug 07).

> zhpy(pronounce (Z.H.?, or zippy) build a layer upon python to
> translate or interact with python in chinese(Traditional or
> Simplified). This project is mainly aimed for education.

## French ##

Gregory (coulix-at-ozforces-dot-com-dot-au) has volunteered to
translate the book to French.

Gérard Labadie (Palmipede) has completed to translate the book to
French, it starts with
[http://www.swaroopch.org/notes/Python_fr:Table_des_Mati%C3%A8res](http://www.swaroopch.org/notes/Python_fr:Table_des_Mati%C3%A8res).

## German ##

Lutz Horn (lutz-dot-horn-at-gmx-dot-de), Bernd Hengelein
(bernd-dot-hengelein-at-gmail-dot-com) and Christoph Zwerschke
(cito-at-online-dot-de) have volunteered to translate the book to
German.

Their translation is located at
[http://abop-german.berlios.de](http://abop-german.berlios.de).

*Lutz Horn* says:

> I'm 32 years old and have a degree of Mathematics from University of
> Heidelberg, Germany. Currently I'm working as a software engineer on
> a publicly funded project to build a web portal for all things
> related to computer science in Germany.The main language I use as a
> professional is Java, but I try to do as much as possible with
> Python behind the scenes. Especially text analysis and conversion is
> very easy with Python. I'm not very familiar with GUI toolkits,
> since most of my programming is about web applications, where the
> user interface is build using Java frameworks like Struts. Currently
> I try to make more use of the functional programming features of
> Python and of generators.  After taking a short look into Ruby, I
> was very impressed with the use of blocks in this
> language. Generally I like the dynamic nature of languages like
> Python and Ruby since it allows me to do things not possible in more
> static languages like Java.I've searched for some kind of
> introduction to programming, suitable to teach a complete
> non-programmer. I've found the book 'How to Think Like a Computer
> Scientist: Learning with Python', and 'Dive into Python'. The first
> is good for beginners but to long to translate. The second is not
> suitable for beginners. I think 'A Byte of Python' falls nicely
> between these, since it is not too long, written to the point, and
> at the same time verbose enough to teach a newbie. Besides this, I
> like the simple DocBook structure, which makes translating the text
> a generation the output in various formats a charm.

*Bernd Hengelein* says:

> Lutz and me are going to do the german translation together. We just
> started with the intro and preface but we will keep you informed
> about the progress we make. Ok, now some personal things about me. I
> am 34 years old and playing with computers since the 1980's, when
> the "Commodore C64" ruled the nurseries. After studying computer
> science I started working as a software engineer. Currently I am
> working in the field of medical imaging for a major german
> company. Although C++ is the main language I (have to) use for my
> daily work, I am constantly looking for new things to learn.Last
> year I fell in love with Python, which is a wonderful language, both
> for its possibilities and its beauty. I read somewhere in the net
> about a guy who said that he likes python, because the code looks so
> beautiful. In my opinion he's absolutly right. At the time I decided
> to learn python, I noticed that there is very little good
> documentation in german available. When I came across your book the
> spontaneous idea of a german translation crossed my mind. Luckily,
> Lutz had the same idea and we can now divide the work.I am looking
> forward to a good cooperation!

for more details.

> _Eirik Vågeskar_: I have always wanted to program, but because I
> speak a small language, the learning process was much harder. Most
> tutorials and books are written in very technical English, so most
> high school graduates will not even have the vocabulary to
> understand what the tutorial is about. When I discovered this book,
> all my problems were solved. "A Byte of Python" used simple
> non-technical language to explain a programming language that is
> just as simple, and these two things make learning Python fun. After
> reading half of the book, I decided that the book was worth
> translating. I hope the translation will help people who have found
> themself in the same situation as me (especially young people), and
> maybe help spread interest for the language among people with less
> technical knowledge.
