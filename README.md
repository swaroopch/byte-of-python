> Somewhere around 2004 - 05 when I was convinced I wasn’t smart enough to be a programmer , I came came across the original A Byte of #Python, and that changed my entire perspective on computing and life , I owe a lot to that book @swaroopch had written.

> I am writing this email to thank you for the great help your book has done for me! It was a really good book that I enjoyed thoroughly. As a 15 year old who has never done programming before, trying to learn Python online was difficult and I couldn't understand anything. But I felt like your book gave was much easier to understand and eased me into the whole new world of programming. Thanks to you, I can now write a high level language with ease. I thought programming would be hard and boring, but with your book's help, I realised how fun and interesting yet simple it can be! I would like to thank you again for your hard work on helping out beginners like me.

> I am a 18 year old IT student studying at University in Ireland. I would like to express my gratitude to you for writing your book "A Byte of Python", I already had knowledge of 3 programming langagues - C, Java and Javascript, and Python was by far the easiest langague I have ever learned, and that was mainly because your book was fantastic and made learning python very simple and interesting. It is one of the best written and easy to follow programming books I have ever read. Congratulations and keep up the great work.

> Dear Swaroop, I am taking a class from an instructor that has no interest in teaching. We are using Learning Python, second edition, by O'Reilly. It is not a text for beginner without any programming knowledge, and an instructor that should be working in another field.  Thank you very much for your book, without it I would be clueless about Python and programming. Thanks a million, you are able to _break the message down_ to a level that beginners can understand and not everyone can.

> First of all, I want to say thanks to you for this great book. I think it is a good book for those who are looking for a beginner's tutorial for Python.
> It is about two or there years ago, I think, when I first heard of this book. At that time, I was unable to read books in English yet, so I got a chinese translation, which took me into the gate of Python programming.
> Recently, I reread this book. This time, of course, the english version. I couldn't believe that I can read the whole book without my dictionary at hand. Of course, it all dues to your effort to make this book an easy-to-understand one.

> I would like to thank you for your book _A Byte of Python_ which i myself find the best way to learn python. I am a 15 year old i live in egypt my name is Ahmed. Python was my second programming language i learn visual basic 6 at school but didn't enjoy it, however i really enjoyed learning python. I made the addressbook program and i was sucessful. i will try to start make more programs and read python programs (if you could tell me source that would be helpful). I will also start on learning java and if you can tell me where to find a tutorial as good as yours for java that would help me a lot. Thanx.

> Before I started to learn Python, I've acquired basic programming skills in Assembly, C, C++, C# and Java. The very reason I wanted to learn Python is it's popular (people are talking about it) and powerful (reality). This book written by Mr. Swaroop is a very good guide for both brand-new programmers and new python programmers. Took 10 half days to go through it. Great Help!

> I wanted to thank you for writing _A Byte Of Python_ (2 & 3 Versions).  It has been invaluable to my learning experience in Python & Programming in general.
> Needless to say, I am a beginner in the programming world, a couple of months of self study up to this point. I had been using youtube tutorials & some other online tutorials including other free books. I decided to dig into your book yesterday, & I've learned more on the first few pages than any other book or tutorial. A few things I had been confused about, were cleared right up with a GREAT example & explanation. Can't wait to read (and learn) more!!
> Thank you so much for not only writing the book, but for putting it under the creative commons license (free). Thank goodness there are unselfish people like you out there to help & teach the rest of us.

> I wrote you back in 2011 and I was just getting into Python and wanted to thank you for your tutorial "A Byte of Python".  Without it, I would have fallen by the wayside.  Since then I have gone on to program a number of functions in my organization with this language with yet more on the horizon.  I would not call myself an advanced programmer by any stretch but I notice the occasional request for assistance now from others since I started using it.  I discovered, while reading "Byte" why I had ceased studying C and C\++ and it was because the book given to me started out with an example containing an augmented assignment.  Of course, there was no explanation for this arrangement of operators and I fell on my head trying to make sense of what was on the written page.  As I recall it was a most frustrating exercise which I eventually abandoned. Doesn't mean C or C++ is impossible to learn, or even that I am stupid, but it does mean that the documentation I worked my way through did not define the symbols and words which is an essential part of any instruction. Just as computers will not be able to understand a computer word or computer symbol that is outside the syntax for the language being used, a student new to any field will not grasp his subject if he encounters words or symbols for which there are no definitions.  You get a "blue screen" as it were in either case.  The solution is simple, though: find the word or symbol and get the proper definition or symbol and lo and behold,the computer or student can proceed.  Your book was so well put together that I found very little in it I couldn't grasp.  So, thank you.  I encourage you to continue to include full definitions of terms.  The documentation with Python is good, once you know, (the examples are its strength from what I see) but in many cases it seems that you have to know in order to understand the documentation which to my mind is not what should be.  Third party tutorials express the need for clarification of the documentation and their success largely depends on the words that are used to describe the terminology.  I have recommended your book to many others. Some in Australia, some in the Caribbean and yet others in the US. It fills a niche no others do.  I hope you are doing well and wish you all the success in the future.

> hey, this is ankush(19). I was facing a great difficulty to start with python. I tried a lot of books but all were bulkier and not target oriented; and then i found this lovely one, which made me love python in no time. Thanks a lot for this "beautiful piece of book".

> I would like to thank you for your excellent guide on Python. I am a molecular biologist (with little programming background) and for my work I need to handle big datasets of DNA sequences and to analyse microscope images. For both things, programming in python has been useful, if not essential to complete and publish a 6-years project.

<!-- -->

> Since this is going to be the first language you learn, you should use A Byte of Python. It really gives a proper introduction into programming in Python and it is paced well enough for the average beginner. The most important thing from then on will be actually starting to practice making your own little programs.
