# Translations

There are many translations of the book available in different human languages, thanks to many tireless volunteers!

If you want to help with these translations, please see the list of volunteers and languages below and decide if you want to start a new translation or help in existing translation projects.

If you plan to start a new translation, please read the [Translation how-to](./translation_howto.md#translation-howto).

## Arabic

Below is the link for the Arabic version. Thanks to Ashraf Ali Khalaf for translating the book, you can read the whole book online at <http://www.khaledhosny.org/byte-of-python/index.html> or you can download it from [sourceforge.net](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/omlx/byteofpython_arabic.pdf?use_mirror=osdn) for more info see <http://itwadi.com/byteofpython_arabi>.

## Azerbaijani

Jahangir Shabiyev (c.shabiev@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Azerbaijani. The translation is in progress at https://www.gitbook.com/book/jahangir-sh/piton-sancmasi


## Brazilian Portuguese

There are two translations in various levels of completion and accessibility. The older translation is now missing/lost, and newer translation is incomplete.

Samuel Dias Neto (samuel.arataca@gmail.com) made the first Brazilian Portuguese translation (older translation) of this book when Python was in 2.3.5 version. This is no longer publicly accessible.

[Rodrigo Amaral](http://rodrigoamaral.net) (rodrigoamaral@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Brazilian Portuguese, (newer translation) which still remains to be completed.

## Catalan

Moises Gomez (moisesgomezgiron@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Catalan. The translation is in progress.

> Moisès Gómez - I am a developer and also a teacher of programming (normally for people without any previous experience).
>
> Some time ago I needed to learn how to program in Python, and Swaroop's work was really helpful. Clear, concise, and complete enough. Just what I needed.
>
> After this experience, I thought some other people in my country could take benefit from it too. But English language can be a barrier.
>
> So, why not try to translate it? And I did for a previous version of BoP.
>
> I my country there are two official languages. I selected the Catalan language assuming that others will translate it to the more widespread Spanish.

## Chinese

In 2017 which is after 11 years, Mo Lun (i@molun.net) re-translated the book from the beginning based on Version 4.0. And the translation is storaged in GitHub and Gitbook. He is keeping follow this translated edition and ready to fix it if there is any wrong or mistake in the translated BoP.

The 2017 translation edition is available in <https://bop.molun.net>.

Mo Lun Says:

> I am a common journalism student from CYU, Beijing. And actually, I am an absolute newbie in Python programming when I start to translate this book. Initially, it was just a whim, but when I done this work, I realized that a decision triggered by interest had prompted me to go so far.
>
> With the help of my predecessors’ translations and the vast amount of information provided by the developed Internet, and with the help of my friends, I prudently presented this translation edition. I just hope my translation work will help other newcomers in learning Python.
>
> At the same time, I am always waiting for my translation of the comments and suggestions, and ready to change or improve this superficial work.

### Earlier Chinese translation

In 2005, Shen Jieyuan translated this book with version 1.20 to Chinese and published it to the Internet. This is the first Chinese edition. In BoP official site, he was called Juan Shen, with Email adderss orion_val@163.com。This edition has been disseminated on the network widely, and the links provided by BoP official site are not available anymore, so that its original source is unable to find. Therefore in here can’t provide a certain address. But you can try to search keywords like “简明Python教程 沈洁元” to find a copy.

Juan Shen says:

> I am a postgraduate at Wireless Telecommunication Graduate School, Beijing University of Technology, China PR. My current research interest is on the synchronization, channel estimation and multi-user detection of multicarrier CDMA system. Python is my major programming language for daily simulation and research job, with the help of Python Numeric, actually. I learned Python just half a year before, but as you can see, it's really easy-understanding, easy-to-use and productive. Just as what is ensured in Swaroop's book, 'It's my favorite programming language now'.
>
> 'A Byte of Python' is my tutorial to learn Python. It's clear and effective to lead you into a world of Python in the shortest time. It's not too long, but efficiently covers almost all important things in Python. I think 'A Byte of Python' should be strongly recommendable for newbies as their first Python tutorial. Just dedicate my translation to the potential millions of Python users in China.

## Chinese Traditional

Fred Lin (gasolin@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Chinese Traditional.

It is available at <http://code.google.com/p/zhpy/wiki/ByteOfZhpy>.

An exciting feature of this translation is that it also contains the _executable chinese python sources_ side by side with the original python sources.

> Fred Lin - I'm working as a network firmware engineer at Delta Network, and I'm also a contributor of TurboGears web framework.
>
> As a python evangelist (:-p), I need some material to promote python language. I found 'A Byte of Python' hit the sweet point for both newbies and experienced programmers. 'A Byte of Python' elaborates the python essentials with affordable size.
>
> The translation are originally based on simplified chinese version, and soon a lot of rewrite were made to fit the current wiki version and the quality of reading.
>
> The recent chinese traditional version also featured with executable chinese python sources, which are achieved by my new 'zhpy' (python in chinese) project (launch from Aug 07).
>
> zhpy(pronounce (Z.H.?, or zippy) build a layer upon python to translate or interact with python in chinese(Traditional or Simplified). This project is mainly aimed for education.

## French

Gregory (coulix@ozforces.com.au) has volunteered to translate the book to French.

Gérard Labadie (gerard.labadie@gmail.com) has completed to translate the book to French.

This translation was later ported to the markdown format, updated to match the last version of the book, and published on GitBook by Romain Gilliotte (rgilliotte@gmail.com).

It can be found at https://rgilliotte.gitbook.io/byte-of-python/

## German

Lutz Horn (lutz.horn@gmx.de), Bernd Hengelein (bernd.hengelein@gmail.com) and Christoph Zwerschke (cito@online.de) have volunteered to translate the book to German.

Translation can be found at http://cito.github.io/byte_of_python/

<!-- Their translation was located at http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub//sourceforge/a/ab/abop-german.berlios/ -->

Lutz Horn says:

> I'm 32 years old and have a degree of Mathematics from University of Heidelberg, Germany. Currently I'm working as a software engineer on a publicly funded project to build a web portal for all things related to computer science in Germany.The main language I use as a professional is Java, but I try to do as much as possible with Python behind the scenes. Especially text analysis and conversion is very easy with Python. I'm not very familiar with GUI toolkits, since most of my programming is about web applications, where the user interface is build using Java frameworks like Struts. Currently I try to make more use of the functional programming features of Python and of generators.  After taking a short look into Ruby, I was very impressed with the use of blocks in this language. Generally I like the dynamic nature of languages like Python and Ruby since it allows me to do things not possible in more static languages like Java.I've searched for some kind of introduction to programming, suitable to teach a complete non-programmer. I've found the book 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python', and 'Dive into Python'. The first is good for beginners but to long to translate. The second is not suitable for beginners. I think 'A Byte of Python' falls nicely between these, since it is not too long, written to the point, and at the same time verbose enough to teach a newbie. Besides this, I like the simple DocBook structure, which makes translating the text a generation the output in various formats a charm.

Bernd Hengelein says:

> Lutz and me are going to do the german translation together. We just started with the intro and preface but we will keep you informed about the progress we make. Ok, now some personal things about me. I am 34 years old and playing with computers since the 1980's, when the "Commodore C64" ruled the nurseries. After studying computer science I started working as a software engineer. Currently I am working in the field of medical imaging for a major german company. Although C++ is the main language I (have to) use for my daily work, I am constantly looking for new things to learn.Last year I fell in love with Python, which is a wonderful language, both for its possibilities and its beauty. I read somewhere in the net about a guy who said that he likes python, because the code looks so beautiful. In my opinion he's absolutly right. At the time I decided to learn python, I noticed that there is very little good documentation in german available. When I came across your book the spontaneous idea of a german translation crossed my mind. Luckily, Lutz had the same idea and we can now divide the work.I am looking forward to a good cooperation!

## Greek

The Greek Ubuntu Community [translated the book in Greek](http://wiki.ubuntu-gr.org/byte-of-python-el), for use in our on-line asynchronous Python lessons that take place in our forums. Contact [@savvasradevic](https://twitter.com/savvasradevic) for more information.

- Follow progress at https://github.com/epsimatt/byte-of-python/issues/16

### Older

Jeongbin Park (pjb7687@gmail.com) has translated the book to Korean - <https://github.com/pjb7687/byte_of_python>

> I am Jeongbin Park, currently working as a Biophysics & Bioinformatics researcher in Korea.
>
> A year ago, I was looking for a good tutorial/guide for Python to introduce it to my colleagues, because using Python in such research fields is becoming inevitable due to the user base is growing more and more.
>
> But at that time only few Python books are available in Korean, so I decided to translate your ebook because it looks like one of the best guides that I have ever read!
>
> Currently, the book is almost completely translated in Korean, except some of the text in introduction chapter and the appendixes.
>
> Thank you again for writing such a good guide!

## Mongolian

Ariunsanaa Tunjin (luftballons2010@gmail.com) has volunteered to translate the book to Mongolian.

_Update on Nov 22, 2009_ : Ariunsanaa is on the verge of completing the translation.

## Norwegian (bokmål)

Eirik Vågeskar is a high school student at [Sandvika videregående skole](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandvika_videreg%C3%A5ende_skole) in Norway, a [blogger](http://forbedre.blogspot.com/) and currently translating the book to Norwegian (bokmål).

> _Eirik Vågeskar_: I have always wanted to program, but because I speak a small language, the learning process was much harder. Most tutorials and books are written in very technical English, so most high school graduates will not even have the vocabulary to understand what the tutorial is about. When I discovered this book, all my problems were solved. "A Byte of Python" used simple non-technical language to explain a programming language that is just as simple, and these two things make learning Python fun. After reading half of the book, I decided that the book was worth translating. I hope the translation will help people who have found themself in the same situation as me (especially young people), and maybe help spread interest for the language among people with less technical knowledge.

## Polish

Dominik Kozaczko (dominik@kozaczko.info) has volunteered to translate the book to Polish. Translation is in progress and it's main page is available here: [Ukąś Pythona](http://python.edu.pl/byteofpython/).

_Update_ : The translation is complete and ready as of Oct 2, 2009. Thanks to Dominik, his two students and their friend for their time and effort!

> _Dominik Kozaczko_ - I'm a Computer Science and Information Technology teacher.

## Portuguese

Artur Weber (arturweberguimaraes@gmail.com) has completed a translation of this book to Portuguese (as of Feb 21, 2018) at <https://www.homeyou.com/~edu/introducao>.

> _Artur Weber_: My students study at the Polytechnic faculty in Ecological University in the city of Curitiba (Brazil) and some of them are interested in different papers.
> 
> As they are writing course and academic papers, they always look for interesting articles and pages. I also do my best to find interesting materials which can be the sources for their university works.
>
> I found the materials from your site useful for some of my students who are writing papers based on programming on Python. Actually, that is why I made a decision to perform a Portuguese translation to let my students who don't know English read exciting articles in their mother tongue ( in Portuguese).

## Russian

Albertio Ward (albertioward@gmail.com) has translated the book to Slovak at <http://www.fatcow.com/edu/python-swaroopch-sl/> :

> We are a non-profit organization called "Translation for education". We represent a group of people, mainly students and professors, of the Slavonic University. Here are students from different departments: linguistics, chemistry, biology, etc. We try to find interesting publications on the Internet that can be relevant for us and our university colleagues. Sometimes we find articles by ourselves; other times our professors help us choose the material for translation. After obtaining permission from authors we translate articles and post them in our blog which is available and accessible to our colleagues and friends. These translated publications often help students in their daily study routine.

## Spanish

Gustavo Echeverria says:

> I work as a software engineer in Argentina. I use mostly C# and .Net technologies at work but strictly Python or Ruby in my personal projects. I knew Python many years ago and I got stuck inmediately. Not so long after knowing Python I discovered this book and it helped me to learn the language. Then I volunteered to translate the book to Spanish. Now, after receiving some requests, I've begun to translate "A Byte of Python" with the help of Maximiliano Soler.

Cristian Bermudez Serna says:

> I am student of Telecommunications engineering at the University of Antioquia (Colombia). Months ago, i started to learn Python and found this wonderful book, so i volunteered to get the Spanish translation.
