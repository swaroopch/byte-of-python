# A Byte of Python #

'A Byte of Python' is a free book on programming using the Python
language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for
a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save
text files, then this is the book for you.

This book is written for the latest Python 3, even though Python 2 is
the commonly found version of Python today (read more about it in
[Python 2 versus 3 section](#python-2-versus-3)).

> I recently finished reading Byte of Python, and I thought I really

> Dear Swaroop, I am taking a class from an instructor that has no
> interest in teaching. We are using Learning Python, second edition,
> by O'Reilly. It is not a text for beginner without any programming
> knowledge, and an instructor that should be working in another
> field.  Thank you very much for your book, without it I would be
> clueless about Python and programming. Thanks a million, you are
> able to 'break the message down' to a level that beginners can
> understand and not everyone can.
>
> -- _Joseph Duarte_ (jduarte1-at-cfl-dot-rr-dot-com)

> I love your book! It is the greatest Python tutorial ever, and a
> very useful reference. Brilliant, a true masterpiece! Keep up the
> good work!
>
> -- _Chris-André Sommerseth_

> I'm just e-mailing you to thank you for writing Byte of Python
> online.  I had been attempting Python for a few months prior to
> stumbling across your book, and although I made limited success with
> pyGame, I never completed a program.
>
> Thanks to your simplification of the categories, Python actually
> seems a reachable goal. It seems like I have finally learned the
> foundations and I can continue into my real goal, game development.

> Once again, thanks VERY much for placing such a structured and
> helpful guide to basic programming on the web.  It shoved me into
> and out of OOP with an understanding where two text books had
> failed.

> I would like to thank you for your book 'A byte of python' which i

> Hello Swaroop,
>
> Thank you ever so much for this book!!
>
> This book cleared up many questions I had about certain aspects of
> Python such as object oriented programming.
>
> I do not feel like an expert at OO but I know this book helped me on
> a first step or two.
>
> I have now written several python programs that actually do real things for me as a system administrator.
> They are all procedural oriented but they are small by most peoples standards.
>
> Again, thanks for this book.  Thank you for having it on the web.

> I wrote you back in 2011 and I was just getting into Python and
> wanted to thank you for your tutorial "A Byte of Python".  Without
> it, I would have fallen by the wayside.  Since then I have gone on
> to program a number of functions in my organization with this
> language with yet more on the horizon.  I would not call myself an
> advanced programmer by any stretch but I notice the occasional
> request for assistance now from others since I started using it.  I
> discovered, while reading "Byte" why I had ceased studying C and C++
> and it was because the book given to me started out with an example
> containing an augmented assignment.  Of course, there was no
> explanation for this arrangement of operators and I fell on my head
> trying to make sense of what was on the written page.  As I recall
> it was a most frustrating exercise which I eventually abandoned.
> Doesn't mean C or C++ is impossible to learn, or even that I am
> stupid, but it does mean that the documentation I worked my way
> through did not define the symbols and words which is an essential
> part of any instruction. Just as computers will not be able to
> understand a computer word or computer symbol that is outside the
> syntax for the language being used, a student new to any field will
> not grasp his subject if he encounters words or symbols for which
> there are no definitions.  You get a "blue screen" as it were in
> either case.  The solution is simple, though: find the word or
> symbol and get the proper definition or symbol and lo and behold,the
> computer or student can proceed.  Your book was so well put together
> that I found very little in it I couldn't grasp.  So, thank you.  I
> encourage you to continue to include full definitions of terms.  The
> documentation with Python is good, once you know, (the examples are
> its strength from what I see) but in many cases it seems that you
> have to know in order to understand the documentation which to my
> mind is not what should be.  Third party tutorials express the need
> for clarification of the documentation and their success largely
> depends on the words that are used to describe the terminology.  I
> have recommended your book to many others. Some in Australia, some
> in the Caribbean and yet others in the US. It fills a niche no
> others do.  I hope you are doing well and wish you all the success
> in the future.

> I would like to thank you for your excellent guide on Python. I am a
